# HOW TO RUN?

*To run this application you must have docker-compose installed.*

Run the line `docker-compose up`. If you want the image to run in the backgroud, add the `-d` flag in the typed command.

If you are running in the background and want to see the logs just use the command `docker logs api-clients -f`
